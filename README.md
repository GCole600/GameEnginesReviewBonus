Controls A D (left / right) Space to jump

We are using a command pattern for movement, each movement option is a command which is handled by the input handler to move the player. For the plugin we are using a csv file to store a list of presets to change the players movement speed and jump speed, allowing the player to use "cheats" to change their movement speed and jump height, from low-high depending on which they choose. The buttons on the top right of the screen allow for these choices to be made, with text in the top left letting the player know which preset speed/height is currently active.
